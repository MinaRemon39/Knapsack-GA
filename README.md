## Idea:
> This project was project for bioinformatics system course in EELU
> We asked to solve knapsack problem using our understanding for genetic algorithm
> Knapsack problem: you have knapsak and alot of items want to save them in kanpsack but,
> Knapsack can handle max weight and you can't take all these items with you so we use algorithm
> to give you maximum benefit with these items

## Problem
#### How to apply genetic algorithm on knapsack problem
- First: make random population of chromosomes each chromosome represnts selected items for each item
- Second: fitness function return total benefit if selected item_weights<max_weight
- Third: select parents using roulette wheel method from result from fitness function

- Fourth: apply crossover and mutation for next generation

## Technologies 
1. Python as programming language
2. Flask as micro web framework to turn our algorithm to api 
3. Custom Tkinter to make our gui
